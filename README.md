# Dead of Winter Real Time Multiplayer Board Game

Dead of Winter is a semi-cooperative zombie survival board game originally created by Plaid Hat Games. The problem with complicated board games is that it can take 30 - 45 minutes just to set up a game, and getting your friends in one place isn't always easy. My solution to this is to digitize the game and take it to the web with the power of React.js. Since the game is full of reusable components like cards, tokens, and board sections, React is great for minimizing repeated code and managing the game state. With Firebase, the game state can constantly be updated by any individual player and automatically sent out to all other players, maintaining identical game state in all locations easily and seemlessly. Individual player views for mobile devices, as well as a main view for the overall board, are handled via React Router.

Current Features:

  -Board view (Desktop/Tablet)  
  -Player view (Mobile)  
  -Interactive Zombie/Barricade Tokens  

Features Coming Soon:

  -Main Menu  
  -Firebase Game Instances
